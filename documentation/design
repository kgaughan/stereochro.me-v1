Let's keep this simple.

The site should be, or all intents, a wiki. Borrowing from Tempus.

Weblog entry rendering is the most complex part. There are different ways in
which an entry can be rendered:

Rules:

 1. If a link is provided, so must be a title if the link is not an embed.
 2. At least one of a link or text is required.

Types:

 1. Video embed (link to YouTube, &c., video).
 2. Audio embed (link to MP3 file)
 3. Image embed (link to image - link contents will start with 'img' followed
    by the image's dimensions and URI)
 4. Link (link to something, title is required, possible text, possible via)
 5. Quote (link to something, no title, text, possible via)
 6. Note (no link, possible title, text)
